A simple Python project with one major objective
and one minor objective:

1. (Major) write a Python application that connects to Kraken API,
   requests cryptocurrency exchange rates  periodically, and 
   plots them live. 

2. (Minor) version control in GIT.

Files:

** KAPI.py
API class that performs queries on Krakens's
public API. Returns the price of a currency pair
as a price-point object (Time, Pair ,Kraken sell price)

** Plotter.py
Creates MATPLOTLIB live plotter taking price-point-objects
and returning a plot of the last time period specified by
user

** Cryptotalk.py
Calls KAPI and Plotter with user-determined parameters
Currency-Pair
Time to keep running


Future work: multiple live plots
Future work: exploit arbitrage in cryptocurrencies.
