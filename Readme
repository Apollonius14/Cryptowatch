A simple Python project with one major objective
and one minor objective:

1. (Major) write a Python application that connects to Kraken API,
   requests cryptocurrency exchange rates  periodically, and 
   plots them live. 

2. (Minor) version control in GIT.

Files:

** KAPI.py
API class that performs queries on Krakens's
public API. Returns the price of a currency pair
as a price-point object in a named series in a library 
{Pair: [(Time,Kraken sell price),(T2,P2)...]}

** Plotter.py
Creates MATPLOTLIB plot instance which takes price-point-objects
and returns a live plot 

** Cryptotalk.py
Calls KAPI and Plotter with user-determined parameters
Currency-Pair
Time to keep running
Runs an animation of the live price
